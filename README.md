# Weather App with Django

This is my first app using Django to practice the MVT/MVC architecture. The app utilizes the weather.org API to retrieve weather data.

## Features

- **Weather Data**: Fetches real-time weather information from the weather.org API.
- **MVT/MVC Architecture**: Demonstrates the Model-View-Template/Controller architecture used in Django.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zakaria-source/weather-app-django.git
cd weather

 ### Running the App
Once you have Django and Python installed and have launched your virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies, start the server with:

bash
python manage.py runserver

After that, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to access the app.
